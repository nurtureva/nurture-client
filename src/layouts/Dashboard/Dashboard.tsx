        <p>
          Currently, this directory focuses on three essential categories of
          care: doula services, lactation support, and perinatal mental health
          care. This selection is based on our surveys of expecting and new
          parents' core needs during pregnancy, birth, and early childhood. As
          this project grows, we hope to add more types of care and resources
          for pregnancy, birth, and early parenting.

          help the birthing person and their partner have a positive birth and
          postpartum experience.
